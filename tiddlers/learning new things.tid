Things I'm learning right now:

* ''Fate Core'': A narrative-driven tabletop RPG system.
* ''~JavaScript'': Been learning for a long time. Time to really apply myself, I guess. p5.js is the library I use the most.
* ''Processing'': Same as ~JavaScript. I've been working on some PDFs with printing in mind.
* ''~TiddlyWiki'': This very thing you are staring at right now.
